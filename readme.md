## Authors
- Jakub Bartko xbartk07@stud.fit.vutbr.cz
## Installation
- Download [tar file](https://github.com/bix-1/ISS/blob/master/src/xbartk07.tar.gz)
- Unpack using `tar -xf xbartk07.tar.gz`
- Navigate to `src`
- Install **dependencies** using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Usage
- **Run** using `python3 solution.py`
- **Generate graphs** using `python3 solution.py -g`
## NOTES
- At *merlin.fit.vutbr.cz* run with `/usr/local/bin/python3.8` instead of `python3`
- **SoundFile** *v0.10.0* was used, but due to *merlin* not recognizing its version specification I was forced to ommit it from *requirements.txt*
